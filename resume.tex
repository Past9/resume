    Rewrote a DotNetNuke application from scratch using a C\#/Web API backend and an AngularJS SPA frontend. Engineered Web API to efficiently utilize legacy database using in-memory caching and efficient SQL queries and stored procedures. Site was formerly IE8-only but new version works on all modern browsers, including IE8+. Implemented a new feature into the application using Event Sourcing, CQRS, and Domain Driven Design principles. Utilized clean separation of Web API, domain model, data transer objects, and user interface throughout.

    \smallskip

    Took a large set of IE8-only JavaScript/HTML tools on a customer-facing website and made them compatible with all modern browsers, including IE8+, without changing appearance or functionality.

    Implemented a Content Management System from scratch. Due to its extensible/plugin architecture, it now serves as a platform for an internal application used for employee training, as well as a small conference signup application. Backend is built with MySQL and PHP5 with MVC architecture, frontend is built with HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery.

        Website for a mobile vehicle inspection company. Includes tools for customers to purchase (via PayPal) and schedule inspections, and for company owner to assign them to inspectors based on location. Inspectors can complete inspections using an online form and then send the results to the customers.

        Analytics tool intended to help the Duke University Development Office find alumni from which to solicit donations. Tool displayed a node graph representation of personal relationships between approximately 200,000 Duke alumni using SigmaJS. Graph could be interactively explored by Development Office employees in order to determine who were the most valuable potential donors.

    }

    \medskip

    Gong is an event store I'm developing for use in event-sourced applications and microservice architectures. It is unique because it's written in Rust, the new systems programming language from Mozilla, which I hope to take advantage of in order to achieve high performance and reliability.

    \smallskip

    The secondary purpose of this project is to help me learn the Rust language and evaluate its suitability for full-stack web development. Whether it can be used to build large web applications in a timely manner remains to be seen, but I believe it's an excellent choice for building backend server software such as databases and event stores.
