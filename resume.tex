    Implemented an event store in C\# with an asynchronous Linq-like API for querying event data. Supported storage backends included SQL Server, PostGreSQL, MySQL, SQLite3, MongoDB and in-memory storage.

    \smallskip

    Worked with a team of 3 other developers to build a WPF GUI for a Cox Communications bill-pay kiosk. GUI application included integration with hardware devices (credit card reader, check/document scanner, cash acceptor, and barcode reader) as well as Cox APIs. Aforementioned event store was used to log transaction data for generating receipts and reconciliation reports for the kiosk.

    Rewrote a DotNetNuke application from scratch using a C\#/Web API backend and an AngularJS SPA frontend. Engineered Web API to efficiently utilize legacy database using in-memory caching and efficient SQL queries and stored procedures. Site was formerly IE8-only but new version works on all modern browsers, including IE8+. Implemented a new feature into the application using Event Sourcing, CQRS, and Domain Driven Design principles. Utilized clean separation of Web API, domain model, data transer objects, and user interface throughout.

    \smallskip

    Took a large set of IE8-only JavaScript/HTML tools on a customer-facing website and made them compatible with all modern browsers, including IE8+, without changing appearance or functionality.

    Implemented a Content Management System from scratch. Due to its extensible/plugin architecture, it now serves as a platform for an internal application used for employee training, as well as a small conference signup application. Backend is built with MySQL and PHP5 with MVC architecture, frontend is built with HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery.

        Website for a mobile vehicle inspection company. Includes tools for customers to purchase (via PayPal) and schedule inspections, and for company owner to assign them to inspectors based on location. Inspectors can complete inspections using an online form and then send the results to the customers.

        Analytics tool intended to help the Duke University Development Office find alumni from which to solicit donations. Tool displayed a node graph representation of personal relationships between approximately 200,000 Duke alumni using SigmaJS. Graph could be interactively explored by Development Office employees in order to determine who were the most valuable potential donors.

    EarlDB is an experimental event store database written in the Rust programming language. It is intended for use in event-sourced applications. It is in very early stages of development, but planned features include transaction support, sharding, and replication. I am undertaking this project partly to satisfy my own desire for a cross-platform, natively compiled event store database and partly to learn about how the previously mentioned database concepts are implemented. It is also an exercise in becoming more proficient with the Rust programming language.
